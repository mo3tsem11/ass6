 Write a program that calculates the required heater activation time according to the input temperature of water. 
- if input temperature is from 0 to 30, then required heating time = 7 mins.
- if input temperature is from 30 to 60, then required heating time = 5 mins.
- if input temperature is from 60 to 90, then required heating time = 3 mins.
- if input temperature is more than 90, then required heating time = 1 mins.
- if temperature is invalid (more than 100), display "Invalid input"
